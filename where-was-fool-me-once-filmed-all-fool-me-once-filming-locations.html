The show is adapted from best selling author Harlan Coben’s novel of the same name, and utilizes much of the same plot. However, there are some key differences between the book and the series, most of which are related to the setting.</p><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=706 data-injectable=true>Fool Me Once follows Maya (Keegan), a former army pilot whose husband Joe was brutally murdered. Or so she thinks. After the funeral, she happens to see Joe prowling around thanks to a secret nanny cam, leading to all sorts of intrigue and the sort of cliff hangers that encourage viewers to rush to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">press the “Play Next Episode” button</a>.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>Although the excellent plotting and writing of the show is a major reason for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">its success</a>, commenters online have also pointed out that the backdrop to the series is astounding. There are shots of elegant stately homes, sweeping green fields, and quaint, historic town centers.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>If you also found the filming locations were so stunning that they made you want to visit the town of Winhurst (in spite of all the murder and deceit), you’re not alone. Read on to find out where Fool Me Once was filmed!</p><h2 id=h-where-is-fool-me-once-set data-injectable=false>Where is Fool Me Once set?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/fool-me-once-netflix.jpg><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true>Coben’s novel is set in the States (New York and New Jersey, to be precise), but the Netflix adaptation is based in the North of England, in a fictional town called Winhurst.</p><p data-characters=226 data-current-count=226 data-injectable=false>Sadly, Winhurst is not a real place. However, the filming locations and other geographical clues would lead us to believe it’s around the Manchester area. In fact, much of the series was filmed in that region of the U.K.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">RadioTimes</a>, series star Michelle Keegan said that this change really allowed her to get to grips with the character: “The book’s set in New York so it’s totally different now because they’re in Manchester. It sort of grounded it for me.”</p><p data-characters=182 data-current-count=182 data-injectable=false>Keegan made her name in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">long-running soap opera Coronation Street</a>, which is also set in the Greater Manchester area. So, it makes sense that this was familiar territory for her.</p><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Absolutely Fabulous</a> legend Joanna Lumley, who plays the mother of the dead-not-dead Joe, has said that she thinks the switch added a new layer to the story that gives it something different from the novel.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Fool Me Once filming locations guide</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fool-Me-Once-1.jpg><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=331 data-injectable=false>As mentioned above, Fool Me Once was filmed in numerous locations in the North of England. The country’s third largest city Manchester was a key location, as was the smaller town of Oldham. The rolling green countryside of Cheshire, which is known for being home to numerous wealthy soccer stars, was also used as a backdrop.</p><p data-characters=445 data-current-count=776 data-injectable=true>Joe and Maya’s wedding was filmed at Arley Hall and Gardens in Cheshire. The gorgeous stately home, referred to as Farmwood in the show, was in the Warburton family from the 15th century until the late 1800s. If you’re interested in the British nobility, a full list of Warburtons who lived there can be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">found here</a>. Cottages on the estate were used for filming some scenes, and it was also used as a backdrop for Joe’s funeral.</p><p data-characters=184 data-current-count=184 data-injectable=false>Producer Jessica Taylor said that Coben was key in acquiring the hall as a location, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">telling the Manchester Evening News</a> that the author wanted it “to look really English.”</p><p data-characters=249 data-current-count=433 data-injectable=true>Maya’s house was filmed in the town of Alderly Edge in Cheshire, a posh location that’s home to a lot of middle class commuters. The scene showing her and Joe meeting for the first time at a fancy event was filmed at Runway Visitor Park.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fool-Me-Once-3.jpg><p data-characters=180 data-current-count=480 data-injectable=true>The modern looking Bimbal HQ was filmed at The Glasshouse, a tech hub in Alderley Park. Flashbacks that showed Joe’s fancy private school were captured at the Bolton School.</p><p data-characters=209 data-current-count=209 data-injectable=false>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bloody scene of Joe’s alleged murder</a>, shown via flashback, took place in Alexandra Park in Oldham. There are a few more scenes filmed here during the day, showing police trawling the space for clues.</p><p data-characters=250 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>Corey’s den was filmed in the Stockport Air Raid Shelters. If you’re a fan of World War 2 history, these tunnels are well worth a visit. The old bunkers are a little creepy, but also thrumming with history, making them a great attraction.</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=true>Over the course of the show we discover Maya’s sister was also murdered. She goes to see her brother-in-law after Joe’s death, and the home we see them in is located in the quaint village of Bramhall, just south of Manchester. On this location, producer Taylor added that the family they rented the home from didn’t like the way it had been decorated, meaning the crew had to return it “exactly to the way it was when we finished filming.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Fool-Me-Once-helicopter.webp><p data-characters=288 data-current-count=588 data-injectable=true>In the series Maya is a helicopter pilot, and we see her fly from Barton Aerodrome in Eccles to Delamere Forest. Keegan was actually flying the chopper, albeit with help. She called the experience “therapeutic,” other than the landing which was “quite terrifying.”</p><p data-characters=419 data-current-count=419 data-injectable=true>Philip’s Park Cemetery in Greater Manchester was used for the flashback scene of Maya’s sister’s funeral. The scene where she discovers the shocking truth about her sister’s death was set in The Arcade Club in Bury, sometimes referred to as “Europe’s biggest arcade.” Another series of flashbacks that showed Maya during her army days were shot in Almeria in Andalucia, Spain.</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>Castlefield Viaduct was the setting for the major chase scene in the series. The former rail line is now owned by the National Trust, and has been turned into quite a nice walk (as long as you’re not in the center of a murderous conspiracy, of course).</p><p data-characters=244 data-current-count=503 data-injectable=false>The Peveril of The Peak is a famous, traditional pub in Manchester, and was used to film the date scene between Detective Sami Kierce (Adeel Akhtar) and his girlfriend. Salford Lad’s Club was also used as the location for their night out.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZrCglaeybsPArGSfp5%2Bheq6xjKilnJ1dm7atucSdZJqknGKzsLvLZqSeZZ%2BjsKZ5xaKjpqGenHqtu8Kaq6Knnqh8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-was-fool-me-once-filmed-all-fool-me-once-filming-locations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhere-was-fool-me-once-filmed-all-fool-me-once-filming-locations.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhere-was-fool-me-once-filmed-all-fool-me-once-filming-locations.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhere-was-fool-me-once-filmed-all-fool-me-once-filming-locations.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-was-fool-me-once-filmed-all-fool-me-once-filming-locations.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-was-fool-me-once-filmed-all-fool-me-once-filming-locations.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./bad-vs-wild-is-already-looking-like-nick-cannons-version-of-fight-club.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./bad-vs-wild-is-already-looking-like-nick-cannons-version-of-fight-club.html>Bad vs. Wild is already looking like Nick Cannons version of Fight Club</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./netflixs-faith-based-thriller-messiah-leads-viewers-astray.html>Netflix's Faith-Based Thriller Messiah Leads Viewers Astray | TV/Streaming</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./netflixs-faith-based-thriller-messiah-leads-viewers-astray.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
