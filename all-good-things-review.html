It’s a film you may not have heard of. It received only a limited release and wasn’t marketed too heavily. It has big enough names attached to it (Ryan Gosling, Kirsten Dunst and Frank Langella), but still, it would definitely be classified as a smaller film. The man behind the camera here is Andrew Jarecki, who you may remember from the fabulous documentary <strong>Capturing The </strong><strong>Friedmans</strong>. If you’ve seen it, you’ll know that eerie feeling of unease the film had. Jarecki brings back that same feeling and crafts and pretty effective mystery/thriller.<span id=more-13762></span></p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>The film is inspired by true events. The inspiration for the film lies in the story of Robert Durst, known as David Marks in the film. Ryan Gosling plays Marks. David Marks is the son of a very rich and powerful real estate tycoon played terrifically by Frank Langella. David ends up marrying a woman named Katie (Dunst) and the two start a life together.</p><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=813 data-injectable=true>Their life seems ideal at first. They yearn for a life in the country so they move to Vermont. Soon after, David is lured back into the big city (New York) by his father to help out with the family business. Katie isn’t pleased with David returning to the city but she has her own problems to deal with. She’s trying to get into med school. As Katie and David’s lives start to go in totally different directions, they start to grow distant.</p><p data-characters=686 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Over time, David becomes violent and far too controlling. Their relationship worsens, becomes abusive and eventually Katie seeks divorce. She realizes that the way the Marks have set up their money, it’s near impossible for her to receive a settlement. This is a problem since she needs money for med school. Realizing she has to play hard ball, she sends a secret accounting ledger belonging to David’s father, to a Senator. If made public, an investigation into the family would be started and they’d be exposed for the numerous illegal activities they are involved in. It is around this point that Katie goes missing, and to this day, her body has never been found.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><a href=#><img decoding=async title=A alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/All-Good-Things-Kristen-Dunst-and-Ryan-Gosling-thumb-555xauto-35062.jpg width=555 height=297 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p data-characters=411 data-current-count=411 data-injectable=true>As mentioned before, the film is creepy. It starts off innocently enough but when David starts exhibiting weird behaviour, and things start to spiral down, it gets really weird and eerie. Part of the suspenseful atmosphere is due to Jarecki’s direction but a lot of it should be credited to Gosling’s wonderful performance. He completely becomes the character and he emits a very disturbing feeling.</p><p data-characters=387 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>Every time he shows up you’re on nerve. You never quite know what he’s going to do, and you always fear the worst. Constantly muttering to himself, excessive sharp blinks, cross dressing, dark looks and more, it’s safe to say David is an odd man and watching Gosling portray him becomes almost uncomfortable at times. Gosling is the anchor here and he does a great job.</p><p data-characters=351 data-current-count=738 data-injectable=true>David’s personality changes with the flip of a switch and he can go from calm and placid to violent and angry in an instance. Gosling completely captures this personality trait and it’s very effective in the film. David Marks is a very troubled man and he comes off as a very creepy character, giving the film more of an uneasy atmosphere.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Aside from Gosling, almost everyone else gives good performances, especially Langella who is always dependable. He’s menacing and intimidating as Sanford Marks and he has quite the screen presence, capturing your attention every scene he is in. Like Gosling, he puts you on edge in every scene.</p><p data-characters=305 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Philip Baker Hall, who plays one of Marks’ friends later on in the film is also quite good and makes a nice addition to the cast. Dunst is the weakest by far, sauntering around, acting as merely a pawn in Jarecki’s game. She’s not terrible but she’s not entirely convincing either.</p><p style=text-align:center data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><a href=#><img decoding=async title=38729803 alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/38729803-648x360.png width=605 height=330 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p data-characters=540 data-current-count=540 data-injectable=true>Unfortunately for the film, it’s not full of all good things, as one might suspect from the title. Jarecki throws in a number of cliches that make you just kind of sigh and go “oh, that again?”. I’m aware it’s inspired by true events but Jarecki plays up a few elements too much and they do cross into cliche territory. Jarecki also makes the mistake of blatantly picking sides. Durst was never actually charged with the murder of his wife, but in <strong>All Good Things</strong>, Jarecki clearly believes he should have been.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>When it comes to David’s transition from normal to disturbed, it happens a bit too suddenly and takes the viewer off guard. We never really know why he suddenly snaps and becomes the way he does and it’s fairly bothersome. It gives the film a bit of a stilted feel and we kind of feel cheated. Why out of no where does he go from this nice guy to disturbed and violent? It’s choppy and cheap and it does hurt the movie.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>Nevertheless, <strong>All Good Things</strong> provides for a chilling tale, that is no doubt subsidised by facts made up by writers Marc Smerling and Marcus Hinchey. The film comes off as a hybrid of factual research and a bit of imagination, which is fine, but I’m just saying, it shouldn’t all be seen as cold hard facts.</p><p data-characters=229 data-current-count=548 data-injectable=true>It’s dark material we have here but for the most part, it works. While the title may not ring true as there are some bad things, in the end, <strong>All Good Things</strong> proves to be a somewhat flawed yet ultimately satisfying thriller.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false></p><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star></span><span class=icon-star-half></span><span class=icon-star-empty></span><h5 class=review-rating>Good</h5><p class=review-summary>All Good Things is an effective and chilling thriller with strong performances from both its leads, making it worth a watch.</p><p class=review-title>All Good Things Review</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomKWkXZy8sLCMrZ%2BippeoerOx1aKcsGc%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-good-things-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-good-things-review.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-good-things-review.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-good-things-review.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-good-things-review.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-good-things-review.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jerry-recco-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-619837-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jerry-recco-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography-619837-html.html>Jerry Recco Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./wonder-woman-star-lynda-carter-continues-her-campaign-to-replace-hugh-jackman-as-ryan-reynolds-1-troll.html>Wonder Woman star Lynda Carter continues her campaign to replace Hugh Jackman as Ryan Reynolds</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./wonder-woman-star-lynda-carter-continues-her-campaign-to-replace-hugh-jackman-as-ryan-reynolds-1-troll.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
