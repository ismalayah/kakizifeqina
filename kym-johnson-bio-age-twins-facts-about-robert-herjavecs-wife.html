The couple has shared some of the milestones and experiences since the two bundles of joy were added to their family.</p><p>The issue of dirty diapers was a topic that the couple had a lot to talk about. Herjavec quipped that he was spending too much time standing at a changing table. Then the couple went on to voice that they collectively wonder whether the diaper changing will ever end. For their first birthday celebration, the couple spared no expense at the shindig in Sydney, Australia. A whole lot of cake was in abundance and so were the balloons and smiles. The professional dancer did not hesitate to share pictures of the joyous event on her Instagram page.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=facts-about-robert-herjavecs-wife></span><strong>Facts About Robert Herjavec’s Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h4><strong>She is the Founder and Owner of The BOD</strong></h4><p>Kym Johnson is the proud owner of the BOD, which is a platform for people to take dance and fitness classes with the star.
