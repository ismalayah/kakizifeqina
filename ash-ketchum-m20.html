There was, however, a fourth Pokémon, a stubborn <a href=# title="Ash's Pikachu (M20)">Pikachu</a>. Ash decided to choose Pikachu and, after receiving new clothes from <a href=# title="Delia Ketchum">his mother</a>, he left Pallet Town and started his journey.</p><p>After scaring off a <a href=# title="Wild Pokémon">wild</a> flock of angry <a href=# title="Spearow (Pokémon)">Spearow</a>, Ash and Pikachu finally started to bond when a <a href=# title="Ho-Oh (anime)">Ho-Oh</a> suddenly appeared in the sky, flying overhead. They looked in awe at the sight of this unknown Pokémon, as Ho-Oh dropped a <a href=# title="Rainbow Feather">Rainbow Wing</a>. Ash picked it up and then saw a rainbow appear in the sky. Smiling, he promised Pikachu that they would both meet Ho-Oh again someday. Continuing his journey, Ash ventured inside <a href=# title="Viridian Forest">Viridian Forest</a>, where he eventually encountered a <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Caterpie">Caterpie</a>. With the help of Pikachu, he managed to catch it. He also decided to qualify for the <a href=# title="Pokémon League">Pokémon League</a> and managed to win three <a href=# title=Badge>Badges</a>.</p><p>Ash eventually met two other Trainers, <a href=# title=Verity>Verity</a> and <a href=# title=Sorrel>Sorrel</a>, while chasing after an <a href=# title="Entei (Pokémon)">Entei</a>. After the Entei ran away and it started raining, they went looking for shelter. While doing so, they encountered a lonely <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Charmander">Charmander</a> on a rock, weakened from the pouring rain. After a brief argument with Charmander's <a href=# title="Original Trainer">original Trainer</a>, <a href=# title=Cross>Cross</a>, Ash and Verity took Charmander to a cave. Sorrel healed Charmander and it fully recovered by the next day. Offering it a chance to join Ash on his journey, Charmander accepted and was <a href=# title="Caught Pokémon">caught</a> by Ash. Ash continued his journey with Verity and Sorrel, and after he told them about his Rainbow Wing and desire to see Ho-Oh, the three Trainers decided to go to <a href=# title="Mount Tensei">Raizen Mountains</a>, where Ho-Oh was said to appear.</p><p>After encountering Cross again and losing a battle against him, Ash started to question himself and his Pokémon, especially after Cross called him the worst Trainer he had ever seen. Ash faulted his Pokémon for the loss and due to his change of heart and personality, the Rainbow Wing turned dark. Unbeknownst to him, Ash had been followed and watched by a <a href=# title="Marshadow (M20)">Marshadow</a> for some time. Marshadow decided help him bond with Pikachu again by pulling him into a dream that made Ash realize what his Pokémon meant to him and see the error in his ways.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/7/79/Ash_friends_M20.png/375px-Ash_friends_M20.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Ash and his traveling companions<p>Eventually, Ash, Verity, and Sorrel finally reached the Raizen Mountains and its highest peak Mt. Tensei. As Ash proceeded to place the Rainbow Wing on Rainbow Rock to make Ho-Oh appear, he was stopped by Cross and his Incineroar. Cross had been spying on the group for some time and had learned of their quest to find Ho-Oh. He wanted to battle Ho-Oh and tried to steal the Rainbow Wing from Ash. They engaged in another battle and this time Ash managed to beat Cross with his newly evolved Charizard. Despite this, Cross still took the Rainbow Wing however, and placed it atop Rainbow Rock. Due to Cross's evil heart, the Rainbow Wing became corrupted, which in turn corrupted the Marshadow from earlier and nearby wild Pokémon. With newfound power from the corrupted Rainbow Wing, the corrupted Marshadow was able to control the wild Pokémon and had it turn against the humans.</p><p>Ash and Pikachu tried to stop Marshadow, but Pikachu got heavily injured in the process. While shielding Pikachu from the corrupted Pokémon, Ash took the full blast. His body slowly disappeared and all but his consciousness vanished. As a result of this, the corrupted Rainbow Wing withered and freed Marshadow and the other Pokémon of its control. Pikachu then took hold of <a href=# title="Ash's hat">Ash's hat</a> and cried over the loss of his Trainer and best friend (despair and sorrow were so strong that Pikachu unleashed a massive Thunderbolt). Ash's consciousness woke up in a spirit world where he was all alone. Faintly hearing Pikachu's voice, Ash ran towards the sound. Because of this, his body started to regenerate in the real world in a bundle of light, and Pikachu connected with the light to reunite with Ash, fully reviving him.</p><p>Soon after, a new Rainbow Wing appeared before Ash. Ash placed the Rainbow Wing atop Rainbow Rock and this time it recognized the Trainer's pure heart. A rainbow appeared, followed by Ho-Oh flying over Mt. Tensei. Ho-Oh and Ash had a battle, and afterwards went their separate ways. After healing at a Pokémon Center, Ash, Verity, and Sorrel said their goodbyes to Cross, who had changed his ways and promised to battle against Ash again someday. Sometime after, Ash also split ways with Verity and Sorrel, who both went to pursue their own goals. Ash continued his journey with Pikachu, vowing to once become a Pokémon Master.</p><h4><span class=mw-headline id=The_Power_of_Us><i>The Power of Us</i></span></h4><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/ae/Ash_Pok%C3%A9mon_Catch_Race_trophy.png/375px-Ash_Pok%C3%A9mon_Catch_Race_trophy.png decoding=async width=250 height=141 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Ash holding the trophy he won at the Pokémon Catch Race<p>Continuing his journey, Ash acquired new clothes at some point and traveled to <a href=# title="Fula City">Fula City</a> to participate in the <a href=# title="Wind Festival">Wind Festival</a>.

Ash defeated Hoyt's <a href=# title="Phanpy (Pokémon)">Phanpy</a> in a battle, and as a thanks for his intervention, Margo gave him a quick tour through Fula City. Next, Ash decided to participate in the <a href=# title="Pokémon Catch Race">Pokémon Catch Race</a> and was awarded the runner-up prize after stopping a rampaging <a href=# title="Tyranitar (Pokémon)">Tyranitar</a>.</p><p>The next day, Ash met <a href=# title=Risa>Risa</a>, who recognized Ash from the Pokémon Catch Race and wanted him to help her catch a Pokémon. Ash agreed to this, and with his and Pikachu's help, Risa managed to catch an <a href=# title="Eevee (Pokémon)">Eevee</a>. Meanwhile, the Wind Festival was disrupted by minor acts of vandalism. Moreover, the "eternal flame" that protects Fula City was also stolen. With approval from the city's mayor, <a href=# title="Mayor Oliver">Oliver</a>, Ash helped clean up the vandalism and set out to find the eternal flame. Following a trail alongside Risa, <a href=# title=Toren>Toren</a>, <a href=# title=Harriet>Harriet</a>, and Oliver, Ash eventually found out that Margo was behind the vandalism and theft, as she had been trying to stop the townspeople from looking for her friend, the rare Pokémon <a href=# title="Zeraora (M21)">Zeraora</a>.</p><p>Soon after, disaster struck as a bottle containing <a href=# title="Effect Spore (Ability)">Effect Spore</a>, which <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a> had stolen from Fula City's laboratory, exploded and spread a poisonous cloud throughout the city. Ash inspired Risa, Toren, and Harriet to help solve the issue by telling them to use their "Pokémon Power"; working alongside their Pokémon partners to help protect the city. Together, they came up with a plan, with Risa bringing back the eternal flame to its pedestal and trying to summon <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Lugia (M21)">Lugia</a>, Harriet powering up the city's old power plant and windmill to blow away the Effect Spore, and Toren trying to create an antidote for the Effect Spore alongside his laboratory colleagues.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ash decided to convince Zeraora that not all humans are bad, as it was hunted by humans in the past and had lost all trust in them save for Margo. Ash battled Zeraora with Pikachu, but one of Zeraora's <a href=# title="Electric (type)">Electric</a> attacks went awry and headed towards a group of wild Pokémon. Ash stepped in to protect the Pokémon and got slightly injured, causing Zeraora to realize he was right. Alongside Zeraora, Oliver, and many other townspeople, Ash helped put out a forest fire caused by the Effect Spore. Eventually, the Effect Spore was neutralized with the help of Toren, Harriet, and <a href=# title=Callahan>Callahan</a>; and the remaining fires were doused by Lugia, who was successfully summoned by Risa.</p><p>With Fula City saved, Ash participated in the Wind Festival with his new friends, and Oliver declared that the city would live with Zeraora in peace from now on. After the festival ended, Ash left Fula City and continued on his journey.</p><table align=center><tbody readability=2><tr readability=4><td width=50px align=center><a href=# class=image><img alt=050Diglett.png src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/a/a6/0050Diglett.png/75px-0050Diglett.png decoding=async width=50 height=50 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></td><td><b>This section is incomplete.</b><br>Please feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.<br>Reason: Expansion of role in <i>Secrets of the Jungle</i>, and <i>Distant Blue Sky!</i></td></tr></tbody></table><h4><span class=mw-headline id=Secrets_of_the_Jungle><i>Secrets of the Jungle</i></span></h4><p>Ash reappeared in <i><a href=# title=M23>Secrets of the Jungle</a></i>, where he traveled to the <a href=# title="Forest of Okoya">Forest of Okoya</a>.
