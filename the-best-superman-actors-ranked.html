<time>30 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=459 data-injectable=true data-video=true>As the original superhero, <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Superman</a></strong> has been depicted on film more times than most, as multiple actors have donned the Last Son of Krypton’s red trunks since his creation in 1938. And, while his portrayals haven’t tended to vary quite as much as the sometimes-campy, sometimes-gritty Batman, every new incarnation of Kal-El has brought something new to the table, from the messianic figure of Henry Cavill to the super-dad that is Tyler Hoechlin.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=493 data-current-count=493 data-injectable=true>But who are the very best on-screen Supermen we’ve ever had? Across movie and TV, including both live-action and animated, there has been an abundance of Men of Tomorrow taking to the skies above Metropolis. Whether they starred in Golden Age movie serials or CW teen dramas, every one of them has been as valid as each other, although some obviously struck more of a chord with viewers and tapped into what has kept Clark Kent at the forefront of popular culture for the past 85 years.</p><p data-characters=227 data-current-count=227 data-injectable=false>So, as we approach the advent of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">yet another new incarnation</a> of the character, following Cavill’s latest (<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">and, we think, final</a>) exit from the DCU, here’s a rundown of the 10 greatest actors to have played Superman.</p><h2 id=h-kirk-alyn data-injectable=false>Kirk Alyn</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/kirk-alyn-superman-e1649104429955.jpg><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>First of all, let’s give some props to the OG Man of Steel, Kirk Alyn. 10 years after his creation, Clark Kent made his first live-action appearance in 1948’s 15-part Superman movie serial. Cast in the title role was Kirk Alyn, hired due to his dancing experience and athletic build. Though a little hokey by today’s standards — especially his high-waisted costume — Alyn’s unflappable Supes established the core tenets of the character right out the bat.</p><h2 id=h-dean-cain data-injectable=false>Dean Cain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dean-can-teri-hatcher-lois-and-clark-2.jpg><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=735 data-injectable=true>While he’s mostly known nowadays for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">airing his unwanted opinions</a> on Fox News, Dean Cain was once a hero to a generation of DC lovers back in the 1990s. Lois & Clark: The New Adventures might have put the emphasis on the romance between its two titular leads over superheroics, but Cain’s charming everyman Clark Kent proved a likable take on the hero and he shared great chemistry with Teri Hatcher’s Lois Lane.</p><h2 id=h-brandon-routh data-injectable=false>Brandon Routh</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/film_supermanreturns.webp><p data-characters=486 data-current-count=786 data-injectable=true>Superman Returns is a very flawed film, but it’s hard to deny that Brandon Routh was terrific casting as the Last Son of Krypton. While hampered slightly by being forced to do an impersonation of Christopher Reeve, Routh brings a lot of depth to a lovelorn and lonely interpretation of Kal-El. Fans were delighted when he eventually got to reprise his role in The CW’s Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover event (opposite Tom Welling and Tyler Hoechlin, more on them later).</p><h2 id=h-george-reeves data-injectable=false>George Reeves</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/george-reeves-superman-e1649104663217.jpg><p data-characters=455 data-current-count=755 data-injectable=true>While Alyn played Superman in two movie serials, George Reeves took over the role for his first feature-length outing in 1951’s Superman and the Mole Men, which proved so successful that it spawned the Adventures of Superman TV series. The hit show made Reeves synonymous with the character until the similarly named Reeve took on the role decades later. With his square-jawed looks and ex-boxer physique, Reeves was the perfect Supes for the time.</p><h2 id=h-tim-daly-george-newbern data-injectable=false>Tim Daly/George Newbern</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/George_Newbern_Justice_League_Animated-Supermen_WGTC.jpg><p data-characters=536 data-current-count=836 data-injectable=true>Although many individuals have voiced him over time, the award for the very best animated Superman has to be shared by the two actors to play him in the seminal DC Animated Universe — Tim Daly, who starred in Superman: The Animated Series, and George Newbern, who replaced him in Justice League and Justice League Unlimited. Both men brought a grounded warmth and humor to the part, but they could also sell the hero’s strength and power, helping to ensure their shows were much more than just cartoons for kids in the process.</p><h2 id=h-tom-welling data-injectable=false>Tom Welling</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/smallville-season-10-finale-tom-welling-superman.jpg><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=true>How does Tom Welling rank so high on this list when he never actually donned the cape? Well, that’s what he deserves for playing Clark Kent for 10 whole years on Smallville, making him the definitive iteration of the character for a whole generation. With no flights, no tights, Welling was able to explore the human side of the hero better than anyone else, before he eventually got to rip open his shirt to reveal the iconic ‘S’ shield in the series finale.</p><h2 id=h-henry-cavill data-injectable=false>Henry Cavill</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/henry-cavill-superman.jpg><p data-characters=530 data-current-count=830 data-injectable=true>Zack Snyder’s glum reinvention of Kal-El might inspire devotion and derision in equal measure, but it can’t be denied that Henry Cavill was the only choice for the Superman of the 2010s. On top of looking like he’s walked straight off the comic book page, Cavill’s Supes convinces us that he’s a man with the whole world on his shoulders better than any other on-screen portrayal. Needless to say, it’s tragic his final turn in the character looks set to be <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that Black Adam post-credits scene</a>.</p><h2 id=h-tyler-hoechlin data-injectable=false>Tyler Hoechlin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Superman-and-lois-header.jpg><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=true>While Tyler Hoechlin’s guest spots on Supergirl were enjoyable, the Teen Wolf alum has properly got to make his mark on the role in spinoff Superman & Lois — and he seriously impresses. Uniquely, Hoechlin’s Clark is the father to two teenage boys, allowing us to see him in a whole new light, at once more relatable and vulnerable, as he’s not so much fighting to save the world but protect his family. Unfortunately, the odds are <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">season three will be its last</a>, but let’s just hope it’s a strong one.</p><h2 id=h-christopher-reeve data-injectable=false>Christopher Reeve</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Superman-The-Movie.jpg><p data-characters=537 data-current-count=837 data-injectable=false>It’s been <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exactly 44 years this December</a> since he first took to the skies, but Christopher Reeve arguably remains the ultimate Superman to grace our screens. Nobody before or since has embodied both sides of Kal-El’s identity more adeptly — as shown by that moment from Superman: The Movie <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">that’s always going viral</a>. The likes of Cavill, Hoechlin, and Welling have done a tremendous job of living up to Reeve’s legacy in the intervening decades, but Reeve was the one who truly made us believe a man could fly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZeytMCMrKypnaKirq95wJyrqKqjYr%2Biusqem2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-best-superman-actors-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-best-superman-actors-ranked.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-best-superman-actors-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-best-superman-actors-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-best-superman-actors-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-best-superman-actors-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./blake-griffin-wife-was-he-married-to-brynn-cameron-kids-and-family-608909-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./blake-griffin-wife-was-he-married-to-brynn-cameron-kids-and-family-608909-html.html>Blake Griffin Wife: Was He Married To Brynn Cameron?
